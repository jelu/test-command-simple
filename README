Test-Command-Simple

This test module is intended to simplify testing of external commands.
It does so by running the command under IPC::Open3, closing the stdin
immediately, and reading everything from the command's stdout and stderr.
It then makes the output available to be tested.

It is not (yet?) as feature-rich as Test::Cmd, but I think the
interface to this is much simpler.  Tests also plug directly into the
Test::Builder framework, which plays nice with Test::More.
